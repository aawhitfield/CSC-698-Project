## Game Rules

- **Number Bet**: Bet on a specific number (0-36, 00). If the ball lands on your number, you win 35 times your bet.

  - 1:1 for red or black
  - 35:1 for green (0 or 00)
- **Odd/Even Bet**: Bet on whether the number will be odd or even. If the ball lands on your choice, you win 1:1. Note: 0 and 00 are neither odd nor even.

## Betting Options

1. **Bet on a number**: Enter a number between 0 and 36, or 00.
2. **Bet on a color**: Enter "red", "black", or "green".
